# privacylabel_js
A temporary repository for javascript that generates a privacylabel.org label out of json. Once the code is ready it will be shared on an official Github account.

There are two examples here:
- index.html shows how you can generate a basic label from a shortcode
- index2.html show how you can generate a label from json code.

Shortcodes don't contain comments, so they can only be used to transmit a basic version of the label. If a label has comments to explain things in more detail, then JSON should be used.

Side note: each generated label can display the JSON is represents. Just click on the CODE button in the bottom right of a label.
