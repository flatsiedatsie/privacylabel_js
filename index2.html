    Next, we need to load language data. The privacylabel can automatically be translated into a number or languages.
    
    To get data on a specific language, you can query the privacylabel server if you like.
    
    JSON: https://www.privacylabel.org/languages/json/en-uk
    
    Aternatively, if there is a global variable called "privacylabel-languages" available, that can be used to load the languages.
    JS: https://www.privacylabel.org/languages/js/en-uk
    
    To load all available languages, simply include https://www.privacylabel.org/languages/js/ 
    
    So you could simply do <script src="https://www.privacylabel.org/languages/js/" /> before you create the label to have all languages. That's what this example does.
